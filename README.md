# JobTrackr Backend

A modular, extensible backend for authentication and user management, built with PHP. Designed as a foundation for job tracking applications, this project emphasizes clean architecture, maintainability, and scalability.

## Overview

This backend leverages a layered architecture, separating concerns across Controllers, Services, and Repositories. It provides robust user authentication, secure password handling, and token-based access control, making it suitable for production-grade applications.

## Features

- Modular codebase (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
- User registration and authentication
- Token-based authentication (Laravel Sanctum)
- Database migrations and seeders
- Easily extendable for additional business logic

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.0
- Composer
- MySQL or compatible database

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jobtrackr-backend.git
   cd jobtrackr-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update environment variables as needed.

4. **Generate application key**
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **(Optional) Seed the database**
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

7. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

## Project Structure

- `app/Http/Controllers/` — API controllers
- `app/Services/` — Business logic
- `app/Repositories/` — Data access layer
- `app/Models/` — Eloquent models
- `routes/` — Route definitions
- `database/migrations/` — Database schema
- `database/seeders/` — Seed data

## Extending

The codebase is structured for easy extension. To add new features:
- Implement business logic in the `Services` layer.
- Abstract data access in the `Repositories` layer.
- Expose new endpoints via `Controllers` and `routes/api.php`.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:
```bash
php artisan test
```
